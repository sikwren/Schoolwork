This is the first of my university's upperlevel computer sciences class (and the first 3000 class) I've taken. This is a Data Sturctures course taught in Java. Will cover "basic concepts and analysis of data representation and associated algorithms, including linearly-linked lists, multi-linked structures, trees, searching, and sorting" and is required of all computer science majors. This class was taken during the Spring 2016 semester.

These files are all my homeworks, lab assignments, and programming quizzes.
