This is the second class in my University's introduction courses to programming. It continues on what the previous class laid out while also teaching the princples of object-oriented programming and how to apply them to programming in Java; "Fundamental principles of computer programming. Expressions, procedures, variable types, data, input/output. Emphasis on structure and clarity as well as correctness." This course was taking during the Summer 2015 semester. 

These files are all my homeworks, lab assignments, and programming section of the course's exams.
